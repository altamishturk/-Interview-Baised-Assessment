# Blog App

This is a simple web application that allows users to create and view blog posts. The app is built using JavaScript and fetches blog data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

## Usage

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
The page will display a list of existing blog posts.
To add a new blog post, fill in the title and content fields in the form and click the "Add Blog" button.
To delete a blog post, click the "Delete" button next to the desired blog post.

## Development

This project is developed using vanilla JavaScript and utilizes the fetch API to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API. The main code files can be found in the index.html file.

## Note: 

Creating and Deleting is not real because we are using third party API.
